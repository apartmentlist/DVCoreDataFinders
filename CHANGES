CHANGES

= 0.5 (2013-09-17)

Added `setGlobalFilterPredicate:`, which, if set, adds the predicate to all queries executed by DVCoreDataFinders methods. The filter is added as an **and predicate**. E.g., if you query for "id > 5" and the global filter predicate is set to "isTombstone = NO", the query that is executed is "id > 5 AND isTombstone = NO".

= 0.4 (2013-06-19)

A few breaking API changes:

* rename `fetchResultsController...` to `fetchedResultsController...` (adding "ed" to "fetch" for consistency with Core Data)

* rename `fetchedResultsControllerWithSectionNameKeyPath:...` to `fetchedResultsControllerWithPredicate:sortDescriptors:sectionNameKeyPath:inContext:` (moving the key path to the end)

* for all "fetchRequest..." methods, remove the "inContext:" parameter (it was unused)

New stuff:

* added variants that take a `NSFetchRequest` for situations where you want to set custom options, like `includePendingChanges`, `fetchBatchSize`, `fetchLimit`, etc.

* added `findFirstOrInsertâ€¦` methods: if there are no matching objects, a new object is inserted into the context and `insertBlock`, if provided, is invoked

* change the return type for methods return `id` to `instancetype` for type-checking goodness
